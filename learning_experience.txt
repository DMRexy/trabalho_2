comparing strings for alphabetical order. Found a really elegant solution that works with
pointers instead of the whole string. It fits well to a binary tree. 

Search in binary trees is very interesting. I'm impressed by how powerful it is for searching
specific values. searching all, which requires in this case a depth-first search, seems a bit
weird. lots of backtracking.
