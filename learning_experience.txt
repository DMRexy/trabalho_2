comparing strings for alphabetical order. Found a really elegant solution that works with
pointers instead of the whole string. It fits well to a binary tree. 

Search in binary trees is very interesting. I'm impressed by how powerful it is for searching
specific values. searching all, which requires in this case a depth-first search, seems a bit
weird. lots of backtracking.

I'm having a lot of trouble with pointers to pointers as parameters for functions inside recursion. I'll have to
try that out later with more time. 

passing pointers by adress can be finnicky! it's not needed to repeat the & every time for recursion, I keep messing that up.
